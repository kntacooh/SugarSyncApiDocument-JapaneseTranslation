# Resource Reference

The SugarSync service presents a set of resources that your application can access through the Platform API. The service is hosted at the URL `https://api.sugarsync.com` and all resources are provided from that location. This means that each resource is identified with a URL that begins with `https://api.sugarsync.com`. Your application can make requests through the Platform API using HTTP methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

The following table lists the resources accessible through the Platform API. It also lists the URL for the resource and the HTTP methods that your application can use to make requests related to that resource. Last, it describes the action performed by each method operating on that resource. Click on a resource for further details, such as the XML representation of the resource. Click on an action for further details about the associated request, such as the XML required as input for the request or the XML generated in the response.
